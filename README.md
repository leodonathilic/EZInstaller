# EZInstaller
Simplified BepInEx installation

EZInstaller is a small script project I came up with when my I had to guide my friend while he was setting up BepInEx for one of his game, I understood quite quickly that I wouldn't be able to help out everyone so I made an automated installation!
It's super easy to use, just start it either as a python script, or as executable!

#### Download the Python script by downloading the repo!


#### Download the Executable [here](https://github.com/leodonathilic/EZInstaller/releases/tag/v.1)

## Usage
The usage is quite simple, the script will install the requirements using pip, and the required files too!

### Python 

`py EZInstaller.py`

### Executable

Just right click on it!


# Note

Windows Defend might consider the Executable as a potentially malicious file, you can either ignore it and run it, or if you don't trust the .exe (which I understand) you have the Python version available too!
