# EZInstaller
Simplified BepInEx installation

EZInstaller is a small script project I came up with when my I had to guide my friend while he was setting up BepInEx for one of his game, I understood quite quickly that I wouldn't be able to help out everyone so I made an automated installation!
It's super easy to use, just start it either as a python script, or as executable!
