# EZInstaller
Simplified BepInEx installation

EZInstaller is a small script project I came up with when my I had to guide my friend while he was setting up BepInEx for one of his game, I understood quite quickly that I wouldn't be able to help out everyone so I made an automated installation!
It's super easy to use, just start it either as a python script, or as executable!

#### Download the python script by downloading the repo!


#### Download the executable [here](https://github.com/leodonathilic/EZInstaller/releases/download/untagged-7e8f2a13455eefccf6ed/EZInstall.exe)

## Usage
The usage is quite simple, the script will install the requirements using pip, and the required files too!

### Python 

`py EZInstaller.py`

### Executable

Just right click on it!
